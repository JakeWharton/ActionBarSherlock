ActionBarSherlock Plugins
=========================

Modules provided in this folder are plugins which add functionality to the
ActionBarSherlock library.

The requirements for implementing each plugin are detailed in the `README.md`
file in each plugin folder.


There is also an official plugin for supporting maps which is developed in its
own repository at [JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock-Plugin-Maps][1].
