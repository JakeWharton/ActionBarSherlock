Action Bar Sherlock
===================

ActionBarSherlock is an extension of the [compatibility library][1] designed
to facilitate the use of the action bar design pattern across all versions of
Android through a single API.

The class will automatically use the [native ActionBar][2] implementation on
Android 3.0 or later. For previous versions which do not include ActionBar, a
custom action bar implementation will automatically be wrapped around the
layout. Support for this goes all the way back to Android 1.6.

Try out the sample applications on the Android Market: [Feature Demos][4],
[Shakespeare][5], and [Styled Action Bar][6].
