/**
 * This class plays a set of {@link Animator} objects in the specified order. Animations
 * can be set up to play together, in sequence, or after a specified delay.
 *
 * <p>There are two different approaches to adding animations to a <code>AnimatorSet</code>:
 * either the {@link AnimatorSet#playTogether(Animator[]) playTogether()} or
 * {@link AnimatorSet#playSequentially(Animator[]) playSequentially()} methods can be called to add
 * a set of animations all at once, or the {@link AnimatorSet#play(Animator)} can be
 * used in conjunction with methods in the {@link AnimatorSet.Builder Builder}
 * class to add animations
 * one by one.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is possible to set up a <code>AnimatorSet</code> with circular dependencies between
 * its animations. For example, an animation a1 could be set up to start before animation a2, a2
 * before a3, and a3 before a1. The results of this configuration are undefined, but will typically
 * result in none of the affected animations being played. Because of this (and because
 * circular dependencies do not make logical sense anyway), circular dependencies
 * should be avoided, and the dependency flow of animations should only be in one direction.

    /**
     * The <code>Builder</code> object is a utility class to facilitate adding animations to a
     * <code>AnimatorSet</code> along with the relationships between the various animations. The
     * intention of the <code>Builder</code> methods, along with the {@link
     * AnimatorSet#play(Animator) play()} method of <code>AnimatorSet</code> is to make it possible
     * to express the dependency relationships of animations in a natural way. Developers can also
     * use the {@link AnimatorSet#playTogether(Animator[]) playTogether()} and {@link
     * AnimatorSet#playSequentially(Animator[]) playSequentially()} methods if these suit the need,
     * but it might be easier in some situations to express the AnimatorSet of animations in pairs.
     * <p/>
     * <p>The <code>Builder</code> object cannot be constructed directly, but is rather constructed
     * internally via a call to {@link AnimatorSet#play(Animator)}.</p>
     * <p/>
     * <p>For example, this sets up a AnimatorSet to play anim1 and anim2 at the same time, anim3 to
     * play when anim2 finishes, and anim4 to play when anim3 finishes:</p>
     * <pre>
     *     AnimatorSet s = new AnimatorSet();
     *     s.play(anim1).with(anim2);
     *     s.play(anim2).before(anim3);
     *     s.play(anim4).after(anim3);
     * </pre>
     * <p/>
     * <p>Note in the example that both {@link Builder#before(Animator)} and {@link
     * Builder#after(Animator)} are used. These are just different ways of expressing the same
     * relationship and are provided to make it easier to say things in a way that is more natural,
     * depending on the situation.</p>
     * <p/>
     * <p>It is possible to make several calls into the same <code>Builder</code> object to express
     * multiple relationships. However, note that it is only the animation passed into the initial
     * {@link AnimatorSet#play(Animator)} method that is the dependency in any of the successive
     * calls to the <code>Builder</code> object. For example, the following code starts both anim2
     * and anim3 when anim1 ends; there is no direct dependency relationship between anim2 and
     * anim3:
     * <pre>
     *   AnimatorSet s = new AnimatorSet();
     *   s.play(anim1).before(anim2).before(anim3);
     * </pre>
     * If the desired result is to play anim1 then anim2 then anim3, this code expresses the
     * relationship correctly:</p>
     * <pre>
     *   AnimatorSet s = new AnimatorSet();
     *   s.play(anim1).before(anim2);
     *   s.play(anim2).before(anim3);
     * </pre>
     * <p/>
     * <p>Note that it is possible to express relationships that cannot be resolved and will not
     * result in sensible results. For example, <code>play(anim1).after(anim1)</code> makes no
     * sense. In general, circular dependencies like this one (or more indirect ones where a depends
     * on b, which depends on c, which depends on a) should be avoided. Only create AnimatorSets
     * that can boil down to a simple, one-way relationship of animations starting with, before, and
     * after other, different, animations.</p>
