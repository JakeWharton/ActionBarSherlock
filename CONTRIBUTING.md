Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to ActionBarSherlock you can do so through
GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure your code compiles by running `mvn clean verify`. Checkstyle failures
during compilation indicate errors in your style and can be viewed in the
`checkstyle-result.xml` file.
